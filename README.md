# **Greeting API and Frontend**

A simple web application with a Node.js Express backend and a React frontend that provides personalized greetings.

## **Project Overview**

This project consists of:

- A **backend** built with Node.js and Express that provides a `/api/greet` endpoint.
- A **frontend** built with React that allows users to input their name and receive a greeting.
- Optional **deployment** to Vercel or Render for live hosting.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Backend (API) Setup**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install necessary dependencies using npm.
3. If needed, create an environment file (`.env`) to specify configuration settings.
4. Start the server to run the API locally.

### **Frontend Setup**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Start the frontend application to run it locally.

## **How It Works**

- The frontend provides a simple input field where users can enter their name.
- Upon clicking the "Get Greeting" button, a request is sent to the backend API.
- The API processes the request and returns a personalized greeting message.
- The frontend displays the received message on the page.

## **Deployment**

- The backend can be deployed on platforms like **Render** or **Vercel**.
- The frontend can be hosted on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
- Once deployed, ensure that the frontend correctly points to the backend's live API URL.

## **Live Demo**

- [The live links for the frontend and backend will be provided after deployment](https://greeting-app-gules.vercel.app/).
